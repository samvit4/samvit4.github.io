Hello! I studied Mathematics and Computing at IIT Delhi and pursued an MSc in Language Science and Technology from Saarland University. While I'm generally open-minded and like to solve any sort of mathematically challenging problem. The areas I have experience in are:

Data Science (Supply Chain)
======
I'm fascinated by optimization, logistics, and processes involved in modern supply chains. A lot of the forecasting work I have done in the past touches on this domain. I've come to understand that I like viewing things from this lens.

AI Engineering (Media)
======
I enjoy working on projects and research involving audio-visual technologies, including speech, music, and video. I'm correctly working on consolidating open-source code available in this domain as a hobby (Pure Data, blender, GEM, et cetera).

Language and Information Theory (Speech Disfluencies)
======
I'm interested in how disfluencies (like um, uh, pauses, and repetitions) occur in language and how they can be modeled or processed computationally. Specifically, can they be tied to information theory. I've posted several research papers in this category.
